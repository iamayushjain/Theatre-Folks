# TheatreFolks
TheatreFolks is your personal voice coach that will help you with your warm ups and vocal exercises to improve your voice.

An android app which uses artificial intelligence to help educate and train artists, debators and public speakers by audio processing and accuracy testing, also helps in assigning best suited roles on the basis of the appearance and behaviour of a person.The app also works for those who simply need an audio recording device, such as journalists, students, etc.

For actors in the voice over industry, it’s absolutely essential that they buy all the right equipment to capture the authenticity of their voice in the highest quality format.

TheatreFolks customizes your lessons according to an initial diagnostics test that will demonstrate the challenges you may have with your voice type.
